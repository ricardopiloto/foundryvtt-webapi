# FoundryVTT-WebAPI
A REST API for Foundry VTT based on .netcore and docker.

# What it does?
This API is *read* only. Original idea here was to have means of reading the database files without the need to open the application, either using a phone app or a resposive website.

# Important note
I am no developer, I'm learning as I go. Any help is welcome.
This is a proof of concept, it might be dropped without any notice (depending on my free time to adjust/learn and develop).
